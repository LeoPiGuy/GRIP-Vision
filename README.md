# GRIP Vision
This was developed for use in the First Robotics Competition.

This application utilizes an attached webcam to detect objects of a certiain color signiture. This is using a OpenCV pipeline generated by GRIP, an application that visualizes an OpenCV pipeline (https://wpiroboticsprojects.github.io/GRIP/)

The detected color signiture is then viewed through a similar electron-based application used in PixyVision (https://github.com/LeoPiGuy/PixyVision)
